      <h3>Movement Coaching</h3>
      <p>I am now well into my 30s yet never seemed to have outgrown my days at the playground. I have over 15 years experience in breakdancing, 5 years in calesthenic training, as well as  experience in capoeira, acrobatics, stunt work, pole dancing, boxing, brazillian jujitsu, tricking, gymnastics, and parkour. After some inspiration from <a href="http://www.idoportal.com/">Ido Portal</a>, I decided to combine all of my disciplines under the umbrella of "movement" and enjoy finding new ways to challenge my body to move. I would love to help anyone else that wants to test the limits of their body and move like they never have before.</p>
