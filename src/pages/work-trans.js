      <h3>Japanese and Korean Translation/Subtitling</h3>
      <p>After studying abroad in Japan in 2004, I realized I had a passion for learning languages and went on to major in Japanese, live in Japan for 4 years, and then move to Korea for 6 years and learn Korean. During my time abroad, I had many opportunities to freelance translation, interpretation, and subtitling work. I also have experience in building multi-language websites as well.</p>
