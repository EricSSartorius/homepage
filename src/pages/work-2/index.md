![Rentr](thumb.jpg)

[Rentr](http://www.rentr.com) is a start-up company that was in need of a homepage re-design. I was the sole front-end developer, helped with the layout and design of the site, and even modeled and acted for the videos and pictures used on the site. Sass, Jquery, and Jinja2 were used for the build.
