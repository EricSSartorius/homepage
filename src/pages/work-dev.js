      <h3>Front-end Development And UI/UX Design</h3>
      <p>I have 3 years experience with web development and design. I have 2 years experience with the Angular framework(v 1.x) but the past year I have decided to focus more on projects in React. In fact this website you are looking right now was made in React. Although I mostly do front-end programming, I also have experience creating mockups in Sketch and Figma.</p>
